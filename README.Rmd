This is the repo for *"Using R and the tidyverse for Data Science"* given at the 2019 Summer Statistical Institute in May 2019.

## Description

This workshop is designed for those who want to learn how to use R to analyze data. The material is based on Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). We'll talk about how to conduct a complete data analysis from data import to final reporting in R using a suite of packages known as the [**tidyverse**](https://tidyverse.org). The two goals of this workshop are: 1) learn how to use R to answer questions about our data; and 2) write code that is human readable and reproducible. We will also talk about how to share our code and analyses with others.

## Software Requirements

In order to install the workshop materials (e.g., slides, exercises), you'll need **a laptop that can access the internet** (wifi will be available). Before the workshop, install the following:
 
1. A recent version of R (~3.6.0), which is available for free at [cran.r-project.org](http://www.cran.r-project.org)
2. A recent version of RStudio IDE (~1.2.1335), available for free at [www.rstudio.com/download](http://www.rstudio.com/download)
3. The set of relevant R packages, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running the code in `setup.R`.

More detailed instructions can be found on the [workshop website](https://tidy-ds.wjakethompson.com/prework/local/). Don't forget to bring your power cord!
